# Eco-Friendly-Habit-Tracker
## Problem Description
I propose to create an "Eco-Friendly Habit Tracker" web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The problem this project aims to solve is the need for individuals to develop eco-friendly habits and track their progress. Many people want to reduce their environmental impact but often struggle to maintain consistent sustainable practices.

### Key Features
- **Habit Tracking:** Users can define eco-friendly habits they want to adopt, such as reducing water usage, conserving energy, recycling, or using public transport.

- **Daily Check-In:** Users can log their daily activities related to these habits, marking whether they succeeded or need improvement.

- **History:** You can check your check-in history to keep track of your progress and see when you've achieved these awards.

- **Eco-Tips:** Provide users with daily eco-tips or facts to educate and inspire them on sustainable living.

- **Achievement Badges:** Award badges for reaching milestones, creating a sense of accomplishment.

## Motivation
I am passionate about this project for several reasons:

- **Promoting Sustainable Living:** I believe that small, daily changes can have a significant impact on our environment. This application will encourage people to make eco-friendly choices in their daily lives.

- **User Engagement:** I aim to create a user-friendly interface that keeps users engaged and motivated to continue their eco-friendly journey.

- **Positive Impact:** By helping individuals adopt eco-friendly habits, I hope to contribute to a more sustainable and eco-conscious society.
